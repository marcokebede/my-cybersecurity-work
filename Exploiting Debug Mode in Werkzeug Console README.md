Portfolio Project: Exploiting Debug Mode in Werkzeug Console
Project Title: Breaking In Through Debug Mode – Werkzeug Console Misconfiguration
Category: Web Application Security | OWASP Top 10 (A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration)
 
Objective
To demonstrate how an exposed Werkzeug debug console in a Python-based web application can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and full application compromise. The challenge simulated a real-world vulnerability that contributed to the 2015 Patreon breach.
 
 Environment
•	Target Application: Flask-based web app hosted on a vulnerable machine
•	Exposed Werkzeug Console: Accessible via /console endpoint
•	Platform: TryHackMe (vulnerable virtual machine)
 
 Tools & Commands Used
•	Built-in Werkzeug interactive console
•	Python standard library (os, open)
•	Shell commands executed via Python: ls -l, cat app.py
 
 Steps Performed
•	Step 1: Discovered an active debug console at /console, indicating a major misconfiguration.
•	Step 2: Executed remote OS commands from the Python shell using:
              python
              import os; print(os.popen("ls -l").read())
This revealed several files, including todo.db and app.py.
•	Step 3: Read the entire application source using:
               python
               print(open("app.py").read())
•	Step 4: Located and extracted the secret variable inside the Python file:
                secret_flag = "THM{Just_a_tiny_misconfiguration}"
 
 Lessons Learned
•	Even small misconfigurations, like leaving debug mode on, can lead to critical vulnerabilities.
•	Tools like Werkzeug are powerful for development but dangerous if left exposed in production.
•	This challenge reflects a real-world vulnerability that affected Patreon in 2015, where an exposed Werkzeug console was reportedly part of the compromise path.
 
 Outcome
•	Successfully exploited a security misconfiguration to gain remote shell access via Python code execution.
•	Read sensitive application data including source code and secret values.
•	Demonstrated a full path from misconfiguration to critical data disclosure, aligning with OWASP A05:2021.
